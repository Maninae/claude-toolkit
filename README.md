# claude-toolkit

You code on a laptop, a desktop, and a work machine. You build a Claude Code [skill](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) on one and want it everywhere. Your teammate writes a useful [slash command](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands) and you want it too. This repo is the shared toolkit — clone it, run the installer, and every machine gets the same skills and commands instantly. Add new ones from any machine and push them back for everyone.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Maninae/claude-toolkit.git ~/Developer/claude-toolkit
cd ~/Developer/claude-toolkit && ./install.sh
```

The installer symlinks everything into `~/.claude/`. Your existing local commands and skills stay untouched.

## How it works

```
~/Developer/claude-toolkit/           ~/.claude/
├── commands/                         ├── commands/
│   ├── gmp.md           ─symlink─▶  │   ├── gmp.md
│   ├── commit.md        ─symlink─▶  │   ├── commit.md
│   └── ...                           │   └── ...
├── skills/                           ├── skills/
│   ├── senior-architect/ ─symlink─▶  │   ├── senior-architect/
│   └── ...                           │   └── ...
└── install.sh                        └── (local-only items untouched)
```

`install.sh` creates symlinks from `~/.claude` into this repo. If a file already exists and isn't a symlink, it gets skipped — nothing is overwritten.

`/sync-claude-toolkit` works in the other direction: finds real (non-symlinked) files in `~/.claude` that aren't in the repo, copies them in, replaces the originals with symlinks, and pushes.

## Syncing across machines

Created a new skill on your laptop? Push it to the repo:

```
/sync-claude-toolkit
```

Pull it on your other machines:

```bash
cd ~/Developer/claude-toolkit && git pull && ./install.sh
```

## Adding new items

**Command** — drop a markdown file in `commands/`:

```markdown
---
description: What the command does
---

# Instructions for Claude when this command runs
```

**Skill** — create a directory in `skills/` with a `SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: When Claude should activate this skill
---

# Domain knowledge and behavioral instructions
```

Or create them anywhere in `~/.claude` and run `/sync-claude-toolkit` to pull them into the repo automatically.
